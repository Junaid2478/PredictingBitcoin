# Predicting the price of Bitcoin Machine Learning Project
The purpose of this project is to develop multiple models for predicting the price of bitcoin. I 
used a historical dataset of previous bitcoin prices to do this. A key aspect of this project was 
cleaning the dataset and applying various pre-processing techniques. There were a variety of 
machine learning methods utilized in this project, including linear regression, K-nearest neighbour, 
Random Forest regression, and long short-term memory. Following this, I used a stacked regressor 
to see whether it could yield even better results. The findings were mostly uninspiring; we 
discovered that the machine learning algorithms were far too simplistic to provide significant 
results. We also discovered that the LSTM model could only predict the next value and did not 
predict with the same considerations as our other algorithms. We discovered that our stacked 
regressor performed worse than any individual model during our implementation. Finally, we 
were able to construct a dashboard that helped us visualise and comprehend our findings. We 
made sure that this dashboard was accessible to a wide range of people, with a special focus on 
people with poor vision and colour blindness.
